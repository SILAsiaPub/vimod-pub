 Getting Started with Vimod Pub
2

What you need to make this process work:
4	
1. Have Java installed on your computer. From: http://java.com/en/download/index.jsp.
5	
2. Ensure that Java is in your %path% variable. 
6	
3. Have a copy of saxon9.jar or saxon9HE.jar on your computer. 
7	
   Contained in Kernow from: http://sourceforge.net/projects/kernowforsaxon
8	
   (Kernow is very useful when you are ready to experiment with xslt transformation.)
9	
   or from: http://saxon.sourceforge.net/
10	
4. Edit the setup-pub\essential_installed.tools file for at least saxon9 variable.
11	
5. For none XSLT transformations you will need to localize setup-pub\user_installed.tools.
12	
13	
14	
15	
When the above is all done.
16	
Open a Command window at the same place as this GettingStarted.txt file.
17	
type 'pub' and press [enter].
18	
Select the appropriate menu item by typing the letter associated with it and pressing [enter].
19	
20	
File structure for projects:
21	
All your files go in a 'project' folder inside a 'group' folder inside the 'data' subfolder .
22	
data\group\project
23	
24	
Where group may be a 'client' or 'iso' code or '2013-08' month or any abitary grouping
25	
depending on how you organize your work. Likewise the 'project' folder can be named 
26	
to suit the overall project. But avoid spaces in path and file names. 
27	
Some things may not work. You are warned. I don't use spaces. So it is untested.
28	
Normally your source files go in the 'project' folder but this is not mandatory.
29	
30	
Your menu and tasks files must go in:
31	
data\group\project\setup
32	
33	
Creating a new Project:
34	
When you create a new folder at the 'group' or 'project' level a new menu item will appear 
35	
automatically based on the name of the folder.
36	
37	
When you make a new Project folder you must make a sub folder called 'setup'.
38	
Within the setup folder you need at least a 'project.menu' file and maybe a yourproject.tasks file.
39	
You can have sub menus started from the 'project.menu'
40	
41	
Menu files and task files have the same format. But some commands do not work at the menu level.
42	
43	
comment or documentation goes before the semicolon   ;command param1 param2
44	
# any line starting with a # is ignored. good for excluding lines temporarily or extra documentation
45	
46	
Here is a simple two line project.menu file:
47	
# project.menu
48	
Transform xml to html              ;tasklist project.tasks
49	
50	
Here is the project.tasks file:
51	
# project.tasks
52	
# lines starting with # are ignored
53	
#
54	
specify the starting file          ;inputfile %projectpath%\books.xml
55	
map xml elements to html           ;xslt generate-match-func2 "defaultelement=span fieldlist='namegroup:div family:div'"
56	
run the transformation             ;xslt generic-html
57	
copy last file to project path     ;outputfile "%projectpath%\familytree.html"
58	
59	
When you run a project:
60	
With in the 'project' folder you created a 'setup' folder. Vimod Pub will create a 'logs'
61	
folder and an 'xml' folder.
62	
'logs' folder contains daily logs that may help you debug if things are not working.
63	
'xml' folder contains the output of each task, named to match the xslt name. There is also
64	
a sequence number and optionally a project code.
65	
i.e. project_code-01-generic-html.xml
